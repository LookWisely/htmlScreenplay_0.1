            When thinking about design, I can't help but address one simple thing. Design is anything.
            When somebody hires someone to fill in as a designer, he wants someone to do thinking for him.
            Literally, just plain thinking.

            Tech and computer science have shaped a lot of our perception about design thinking and even
            often go hand in hand when talking about lucrative industries. It goes far beyond just 
            design thinking. It has shaped plurality, if not majority of our modern analytic approaches. 
            Large portion of applied physics has been transformed
            into "statistical mehcanis", mathematical theorems and lemmas are being proven through extensive
            numeric calculations. Often causation links could be discvered just through automated massive
            data regressions.<br>

            It is impossible to overestimate how much our learning process is tied to computation. It is
            even more prominent in 'mainstream' design professions. Captions like Graphic design, 
            UX design and UI design go, practically always, in unison with 'applications', 'web pages',
            digital print, and where last one is clearly physical, more and more it lately becomes an
            auxiliary mean to a digital service behind it.

            What we rarely account for is that when 

            It is rarely accounted for, that at the beginning of computers, there were infact more then
            one direction to go with

            Much like Church had arguments against Turings model, in philosophical field same
            time period is riddled with very similar dialogue. To put it shortly, yet 'scientifically',
            Cartesian phenomenology and Kantian metaphysics are under heavy criticism for not keeping up
            with tempo of technological discovery and social self-reflection.
